# Contributing

The best was to contribute is to fork https://github.com/perl-net-saml2/perl-Net-SAML2 and send a pull request.

Issues should be reported at [Github Issue](https://github.com/perl-net-saml2/perl-Net-SAML2/issues).

Future Plans:

1. Move to configurable Certificate Verification with Crypt::OpenSSL::Verify replacing Crypt::OpenSSL::VerifyX509 as the default eventually
2. Allow XML Signature Verification to be configurable with XML::Sig possibly replacing Net::SAML2::XML::Sig at the default eventually
3. Allow the certificate files to be provided as text strings to allow applications to store the certificates in their native settings if needed
4. We are open to other suggestions or improvements
